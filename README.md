# Projects
This repository contains different projects that I have completed in Java and Python respectively. 

<h3>
  CSCI 446 - Artifical Intelligence â€“ Sudoku Solver
  </h3>
  <p>
  This projects reads in a .csv file with an incomplete sudoku puzzle and solves it uses multiple different algorithms; Backtracking, Backtracking with Forward Checking, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing. This was a partner project completed with Max Lineberger. I wrote the Genetic Algorithm and the Backtracking with Forward Checking. The other two were written by Max.

<h3>
  CSCI 132 - Basic Data Structures and Algorithms - Cesear's Cipher
  </h3>
  <p>
  This project encodes and then decodes a message that the user inputs. The user also inputs in the key which the message will shift.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
  CSCI 132 - Basic Data Structures and Algorithms - Slot Machine
  </h3>
  <p>
  This project is a slot machine simulator where you are betting, getting the output, maintaining the user's balance and then letting them leave whenever they want. This worked on instantiating a class, calling methods, and while loops. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
  CSCI 132 - Basic Data Structures and Algorithms - Quick Sort
  </h3>
  <p>
  This project is an implementation of a quick sort that sorts a .txt file that is inputted.

  <h3>
  CSCI 127 - Joy and Beauty of Data, Intro to Python - Cribbage Hand
  </h3>
  <p>
  This project evaulates the input data of a cribbage hand and outputs the corresponding score. Works with function calls and handling input data.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
  CSCI 127 - Joy and Beauty of Data, Intro to Python - Inheritance 
  </h3> 
  <p>
  This project went over the concepts of classes and inheritence in python. It follows a Student and what their major means in terms of what college they are in.
